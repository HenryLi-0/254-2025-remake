# Hydrogen

[![Java CI with Gradle](https://github.com/SciBorgs/Hydrogen/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SciBorgs/Hydrogen/actions/workflows/gradle.yml)

The SciBorgs' base repository. It is a living document that should be updated yearly for new libraries and other changes.

## Structure
Our robot code is centered around [Robot.java](src/main/java/org/sciborgs1155/robot/Robot.java).

This project currently contains drive, vision, autos, pathing, and LEDs. You are expected to add/modify code supporting existing files and new subsystems when using this template! Some of these files include but are not limited to:
- **[Autos.java](src/main/java/org/sciborgs1155/robot/commands/Autos.java)** Add code for new subsystems in `configureAutos`, such as commands for `NamedCommands`
- **[DriveConstants.java](src/main/java/org/sciborgs1155/robot/drive/DriveConstants.java)** Modify control constants yearly for each new robot, and all drivetrain constants for each new drivetrain as needed.
- **[VisionConstants.java](src/main/java/org/sciborgs1155/robot/vision/VisionConstants.java)** Add new `CameraConfig` fields representing cameras on the robot, and change the `create` method in [Vision](src/main/java/org/sciborgs1155/robot/vision/Vision.java). Also modify any camera configurations, AprilTag information, and constants if needed.
- **[Constants.java](src/main/java/org/sciborgs1155/robot/Constants.java)** Contains more general robot constants, modify any if needed.
- **[FieldConstants.java](src/main/java/org/sciborgs1155/robot/FieldConstants.java)** Modify this to be updated for each year's game, as it defines the field.
- **[Ports.java](src/main/java/org/sciborgs1155/robot/Ports.java)** Modify existing OI and drive ports, as well as adding new ports and their names.
- **[Robot.java](src/main/java/org/sciborgs1155/robot/Robot.java)** A lot: subsystems, command files, related triggers & bindings, interactions with other subsystems & files, library configurations/starting, etc..
- **[Scisoc](<resources/calibrations/Scisoc - The Borg's Prayer.md>)** Update yearly.
